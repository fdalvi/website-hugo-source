As a Teaching Assistant for the course, part of my responsibilities was to prepare and deliver recitations every Thursday. These recitations reviewed the material from the week's lectures, talked about assignments and just generally served as a platform to clear any lingering confusion or doubts. All these slides were created from scratch, but a lot of inspiration was drawn from previous recitations for the same course.
