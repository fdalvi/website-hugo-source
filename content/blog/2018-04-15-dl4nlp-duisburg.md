Hassan Sajjad and I just had a great time delivering a 5-day crash course at the Universität Duisburg-Essen. It was delivered roughly over 18 hours - with quite a lot of practical exercises! Check out the [course materials](/teaching/2018-dl4nlp-duisburg).

Duisburg was a nice and calm place, with a döner restaurant ready to greet you almost around every corner. The Königstraße was super-lively with a lot of pop-up shops and restaurants, and was quite a fun walk in the afternoon.

We also got featured in the [local newspaper](https://www.waz.de/staedte/duisburg/verdi-warnstreik-50-busse-aus-duisburg-zur-kundgebung-nach-koeln-id213971813.html) (front page!) - though not for the reasons we could have ever imagined. On the second day of the course, there was a strike by the public transportation employees. We were completely unaware of this, and after standing at the bus stop for a while wondering how German transportation could be late, a journalist approached us for the story.

Overall it was an excellent experience, we learned a lot and look forward to future teaching opportunities!
