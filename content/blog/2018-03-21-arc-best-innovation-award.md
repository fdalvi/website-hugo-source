One of our projects in the Arabic Language Team at the Qatar Computing Research Institute is the _Speech Translation_ Project - a real-time low-latency system where a speaker's voice is transcribed and translated (both in Arabic or English). Check out the project [here](http://localhost:1313/projects/live-speech-translation/).

This project was recently awarded the **Best Innovation Award** at the annual [Qatar Foundation Annual Research Conference](https://www.qf-arc.org)! It was been a long effort to take our state-of-the-art research in Speech Recognition and Machine Translation and bring it all together in one system. Check out the video below on QCRI's official facebook page to get a glipmse of the project:
