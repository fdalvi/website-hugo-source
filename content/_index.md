I'm a Deep Learning researcher with a penchant for engineering, so I spend my time doing *both*!

I've lately been interested in making my web applications scalable on the engineering end. On the research side, I've been drawn towards Reinforcement Learning, Generative Networks and Evolutionary algorithms. Every now and then, I mentor at local hackathons, give tech advice to upcoming startups and teach courses on deep learning.
