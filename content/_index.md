After graduating from [Carnegie Mellon](https://www.cmu.edu) and [Stanford](https://www.stanford.edu), I realized I was into Machine and Deep Learning research, but also loved engineering. So, I spend my time doing *both*!

I've lately been interested in making my web applications scalable on the engineering end. On the research side, I've been drawn towards Reinforcement Learning, Generative Networks and Evolutionary algorithms. Every now and then, I mentor at local hackathons, give tech advice to upcoming startups and teach courses on deep learning.
