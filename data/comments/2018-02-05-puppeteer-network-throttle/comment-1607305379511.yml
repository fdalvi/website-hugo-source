comment: "The coronavirus pandemic has studied universities to swap to distance learning. free essay writer service <a href=http://goodthesisstatementsdsa.com/>thesis work</a> site:teachertube.com essay service. \r\nBut what is happening nowadays can be called an special delivery of content to audience members in isolation . Most of varsities  and the teachers themselves were not ready for the transition to online. According to a 2019 HSE study, University professors with an academic degree rate their level of proficiency in remote technologies at 3.2 points out of five. One in four people has never used remote video services to take part in webinars or video conferences in the past three years. \r\nBut professors are not required to own online studying technologies. They were simply not ready for this, although education and its new methods are the main function of colleges. Try to oblige the surgeon to do their work from home. Let him explain to the patient via Skype how to remove his appendicitis. It sounds crazy. Therefore, the resourcefulness with which teachers adapt to the remote format is commendable. \r\n \r\nSometimes it gets funny. Colleagues from regional academies told that some professors asked to write abstracts by hand and send them scans for according.Today, people communicate remotely in real time thanks to new digital technologies, students can \"raise their hands\" with a single button, they can write with a finger on a tablet as on a blackboard, and they are told: \"Please write a handwritten conspectus and send the scan.\" Or, for example, this case: a physical education educator asked students to shoot five-minute videos where they show physical exercises. In spite of the fact that remote physical excercises can be more original, for example, you can do selection of ready-made videos on YouTube, find checklists in the popular domain, and teach them to play sports at home, while you can't go outside anywhere. \r\n \r\nUniversity teachers are faced with a lack of guidance and difficulties in dealing with organizational matters. Someone conduct lectures on Skype, someone -in Zoom, some of them only sends lectures to WhatsApp. Some professors record lessons on a webcam and send them to their students. The quality of such materials is minimal, and it is hard to perceive them. At least because the content on YouTube, which students are used to, is shot and edited professionally and the viewer is spoiled by the quality of video materials. \r\nThere are also problems with monitoring attendance. Some teachers ask you to put a \" + \" in the chat, others require  you to turn on Webcams and take screenshots of students. Against the background of all the misunderstandings and difficulties, one element of academic life remains unchanged - assessment. Students don't get an educational experience on campus, but they will get grades, even formal ones. \r\n<a href=http://goodthesisstatementsdsa.com/>thesis statement creator</a> \r\nLearning online from home does not have these disadvantages, because it is built on a carefully designed learning process in an electronic information and educational environment. Teachers have instructions, manuals, memos,checklists, templates for emails and notifications, and even presentations. Everything is thought out here-from the screen saver before the lesson to the slide with homework."
