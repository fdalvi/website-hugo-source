  trop bonnn ***  Haha-  I assumed she didn't mean that, but having played it a
  bit as a kid the urban dictionary definition isn't too far out Of course busy
  people can have a relationship.  It takes patience & understanding.  Your BF
  is already conscious that he is spending a lot of time at work.  His
  acknowledgement of his conflicting obligations is a good sign.  On your side,
  you need to be grateful for his awareness & accept that this is a temporary
  situation.  When the 2 projects & the holidays are over, with exams being
  behind him, you two will have more time for each other.  If you pester him or
  whine, he will leave.   <a

  </a> They are a germ if you are looking for lots of sensuality, kisses,
  cuddling or some enjoyable show from them  Thank you for answering. See, he
  said that he believes in giving rather than taking, just like I do. That is
  what drew him to me, after all. He had been with women who just took and he is
  really tired from that. That's why his explanation seems weird to me. We were
  talking to some other people there and there was a man who said that his
  girlfriend left him because they were apart from each other. My boyfriend said
  that this man should forget her, becasue she is not the one if she acted like
  that. But now, he is doing the same thing to us. I don't know. Do you think
  that he got scared maybe? He was in the long-distance relationship before and
  that relatinship did not end very well, so he doesn't want to get dissapointed
  again. He also told me that he could have had another long-distance
  relationship, but he did not because of all of the things that you can
  experience with these kind of relatioships. It really makes no difference to
  me.  There are so many other important factors, age really isn't any kind of
  deal breaker for me at all.   <a
