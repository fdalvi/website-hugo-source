abstract: "Malware Inc. is a project that aims to study the development of Malware on various platforms, such as Web browsers, Social networks and Web engines. I chose Mozilla Firefox as my research platform, as it is the second most widely used web browser today. Having a wide audience adds to the importance of this research project, because the security of a higher number of people is at stake. My role in this research project was to study Firefox extensions, small pieces of code that help in enhancing the browsing experience. These extensions, although very helpful, have the potential to be used for malicious purposes."
