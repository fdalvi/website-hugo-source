abstract: "“I want my Mommy” is a research project that aims to use wireless technologies such as Bluetooth and Wi-Fi to quickly locate people in a large crowd, subsequently reducing the number of lost people. In several crowded areas such as Makkah and Disneyland, people getting separated (specially children and elderly) from their families is a huge problem. This is currently handled manually by making announcements or giving people tags with information written on them. Unfortunately, these solutions do not work in highly crowded areas, both because of the number of people entering the location, and because of the size of these places. We plan to devise an algorithm using commonly existing wireless technologies to reduce the number of lost people by categorizing the crowd into groups without any barrier-to-entry."
