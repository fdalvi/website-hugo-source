abstract: "This work aims to explore the role of Natural Gestures in daily interaction with computer systems, in particular, their use in the navigation of touchscreen interfaces. Gestures provide a way for users to navigate an interface through intuitive on­screen touch motions and are leading to a shift from traditional point and click interactions to a more natural and physical way of interaction. Given the increased popularity of public touchscreen kiosks in various settings such as airports, hospitals and company lobbies, we designed and built a test­bed platform for exploring touchscreen interface design for users of mixed lingual and cultural backgrounds. Inspired by the increasing prominence of gestures in commercial touchscreen devices, our aim was to explore the effects of language and culture on gestures, including the impact of various aspects such as screen size on the usability and practicality of these gestures. We implemented a few of these gestures into our interface, such as natural scrolling, which enables the user to flick their fingers across the screen in order to browse through a list of items. As part of future work, we seek to implement additional gestures into the interface such as screen swiping and to deploy this system on a kiosk at Carnegie Mellon Qatar's campus for the purpose of collecting logs and running experiments. Through these experiments we seek to learn more about the interaction of users with the interface, their preferences and navigation performance, while considering the roles of language and culture in this region."
