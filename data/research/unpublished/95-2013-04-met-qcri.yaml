abstract: "The aim of the Meeting translation project is to provide a platform for multi-lingual meetings. In order for the system to work efficiently, a robust backend is required to augment the automatic recognition and translation services. The existing backend was a very simple proof-of-concept that supported a single user only. The goal of this project was to develop a backend that could support the realtime needs of this project. The backend was also required to support multiple users and meetings simultaneously. Another important aspect of the project was to test the robustness and efficiency of the system. Hence, a statistics collection system was also required that could give us enough information about the different processes in the pipeline to analyze and pin-point the deficiencies in the system. Upon completion, a fully working system was built that could support multiple users and meetings. The system integrated well with the translation and transcription services already available. The statistics collection system was also built and the results from the system were used to analyze the bottlenecks in the processing. The system was tested in both the English and the Arabic language."
