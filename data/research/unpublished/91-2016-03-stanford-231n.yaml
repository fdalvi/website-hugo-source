abstract: "Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are powerful tools for image classification and object detection, but they can also be used to generate images. For our project, we use CNNs to create a face generation system. Given a set of desired facial characteristics, we produce a well-formed face that matches these attributes. Potential facial char- acteristics fall within the general categories of raw at- tributes (e.g., big nose, brown hair, etc.), ethnicity (e.g., white, black, Indian), and accessories (e.g. sunglasses, hat, etc.). In our face generation system, we fine-tune a convolutional network pre-trained on faces to create a binary classification system for the potential facial charac- teristics. We then employ a novel technique that models feature activations as a custom Gaussian Mixture Model in order to identify relevant features for feature inversion. Our face generation system has many potential uses, in- cluding identifying suspects in law enforcement settings."
