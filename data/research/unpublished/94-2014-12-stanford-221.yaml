abstract: "We aim to produce a representation of review threads that is concise, interpretable, and preserves much of the meaning of the full text. Further, the representa- tion should be useful for various applications such as summarization, topic modeling, and star-rating pre- diction. This task can be modelled as a feature se- lection problem which consists of two stages: gen- erating feature proposals and filtering/ranking these features. The first stage automatically produces a large set of human-interpretable candidate features, while the second stage reduces that set to achieve a more concise representation."
